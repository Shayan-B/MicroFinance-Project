## Overview

In the new era of Finance field, by leveraging the power of data we are able to evaluate and find anomalies in different finance sub-sectors. Although these anomalies doesn't occur much but in this sensitive field, when they happen they put too much pressure on banks, credit companies, etc. 
One of the new and attractive fields which has been developed because of expanding data science in modern world, is MicroFinance.

Microfinance refers to the provision of financial services, such as loans, savings, and insurance, to individuals or small businesses who typically lack access to traditional banking services. These services are aimed at empowering low-income individuals and communities, especially in developing countries, by providing them with the means to start or expand businesses, invest in education, or cope with emergencies. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) typically offer small loans without collateral requirements.

In recent years, data science has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of microfinance operations. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms, MFIs can analyze vast amounts of data collected from loan applications, borrower profiles, repayment histories, and economic indicators to make informed decisions and manage risk more effectively. Specifically, data science can be leveraged to identify patterns and predict repayment behavior, including the likelihood of late payments or default.
